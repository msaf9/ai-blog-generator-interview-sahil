# AI Blog Generator
This is a Flask‐based AI‐powered blog post generator. Given a keyword, it does SEO research (mocked), calls OpenAI, and returns a blog post in Markdown/HTML. It can also automatically generate daily posts via APScheduler or a cron job.

- [Installation & Setup](#installation--setup)
- [Running Locally](#running-locally)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Example Output](#example-output)

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Git**  
- **An OpenAI API key** (set up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com); you’ll need at least \$5 of credit or a valid billing plan)  
- **Unix-like shell** (macOS or Linux) for cron; macOS/Linux is recommended for APScheduler or cron setup  
- (Optional) jq for pretty‑printing JSON responses in the terminal

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:

```git
git clone https://github.com/msaf9/ai-blog-generator-interview-sahil.git
cd ai-blog-generator-interview-sahil
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
> After activation, your prompt should be prefixed with (venv).

3. Install dependencies:

```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- Flask
- openai
- python-dotenv
- apscheduler
- requests

4. Configure environment variables:

- Create a new .env file in the project root:

- .env should include:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-<your_openai_key_here>
FLASK_ENV=development
```
> Important: .env is in .gitignore; do not commit your secret key.

## Running Locally
1. Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Start the Flask app:
```sh
python app.py
```

- By default, Flask runs on http://0.0.0.0:80 (port 80).
- If you prefer port 5000 (the Flask default), edit the last line of app.py to .run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000).

3. Test the /generate endpoint:
- In a new terminal (venv still active), run:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:80/generate?keyword=wireless%20earbuds" | jq .
```

- Or, if you don’t have jq:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:80/generate?keyword=wireless%20earbuds"
```

- You should receive a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "content": "With related content",
  "seo_data": {
    "avg_cpc": 4.61,
    "keyword_difficulty": 64,
    "search_volume": 12828
  }
}

```
